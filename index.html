                    <span>A simple Hangman game made in Python.
                        Small project that introduced me to the Python language.
                        I mostly learned python syntax, how to manipulate arrays and import libraries, and how to use
                        (I/O)
                        methods.

                    <span>Python script that finds and deletes duplicate files in a folder.
                        This project is written in pure Python using Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub.
                        I learned how to interact with the operating system, how to interact with the file system, and
                        how
                        to use dictionaries.

                    <span>Mobile app that calculates your college GPA.
                        It was made in HTML, CSS, and TypeScript using the Ionic Framework.
                        I learned the basics of making a progressive web app using web technologies.
                        Another goal making this app was learning how to use rich libraries of front-end building blocks
                        and
                        UI components.

                        This project is written in pure JavaScript using Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub, NPM, Google
                        Cloud
                        Translation API and Discord API.
                        I learned the basics of making a bot for Discord, a popular communication app, and other skills
                        that
                        I can apply for other communication apps.

                    <span>An online language learning game created in collaboration with a Senior Software Developer, as
                        a
                        team of two.
                        This project is a work-in-progress using React, .Net Core with C#, Entity Framework, MSSQL,
                        Swagger,
                        NPM, Git, and GitHub.
                        I am learning the basics of making a website and connecting it to an online database.

                    <span>A super light-weight and fast-loading website built using minimal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        My goal with this project was to practice making an aesthetically pleasing, performant, simple,
                        and
                        accessible website.
                        I used semantic elements, alt-text on images, and a color pallet with sufficient contrast to
                        maximize accessibility.
                        Another goal of mine was to make this website responsive, which means the layout will change
                        depending on the userâ€™s browser size.
