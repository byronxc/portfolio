                                Small project that introduced me to the Python language. 
                                I mostly learned python syntax, how to manipulate arrays and import libraries, and how to use (I/O) methods.

                                This project is written in pure Python using Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub. 
                                I learned how to interact with the operating system, how to interact with the file system, and how to use dictionaries.

                                It was made in HTML, CSS, and TypeScript using the Ionic Framework. 
                                I learned the basics of making a progressive web app using web technologies.
                                 Another goal making this app was learning how to use rich libraries of front-end building blocks and UI components.

                                 This project is written in pure JavaScript using Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub, NPM, Google Cloud Translation API and Discord API. 
                                 I learned the basics of making a bot for Discord, a popular communication app, and other skills that I can apply for other communication apps.

                                My goal with this project was to practice making an aesthetically pleasing, performant, simple, and accessible website. 
                                I used semantic elements, alt-text on images, and a color pallet with sufficient contrast to maximize accessibility. 
                                Another goal of mine was to make this website responsive, which means the layout will change depending on the userâ€™s browser size.

                                I am learning the basics of making a website and connecting it to an online database.
