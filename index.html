                        <span>A simple Hangman game made in Python.
                            Small project that introduced me to the Python language.
                            I mostly learned python syntax, how to manipulate arrays and import libraries, and how to use
                            (I/O)
                            methods.

                            This project is written in pure Python using Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub.
                            I learned how to interact with the operating system, how to interact with the file system, and
                            how
                            to use dictionaries.

                            It was made in HTML, CSS, and TypeScript using the Ionic Framework.
                            I learned the basics of making a progressive web app using web technologies.
                            Another goal making this app was learning how to use rich libraries of front-end building blocks
                            and
                            UI components.

                            I can apply for other communication apps.

                            a
                            team of two.
                            This project is a work-in-progress using React, .Net Core with C#, Entity Framework, MSSQL,
                            Swagger,

                        <span>A super light-weight and fast-loading website built using minimal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                            My goal with this project was to practice making an aesthetically pleasing, performant, simple,
                            and
                            accessible website.
                            I used semantic elements, alt-text on images, and a color pallet with sufficient contrast to
                            maximize accessibility.
                            Another goal of mine was to make this website responsive, which means the layout will change
                            depending on the userâ€™s browser size.
